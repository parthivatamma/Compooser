Review:<p>The best laptop for kids must be secure, simple to use, and can outlast them past naptime. Google Pixelbook Go ticks off all those requirements and then some, with its astounding battery life and security-oriented ChromeOS environment. It&apos;s lightweight but relatively durable, making it a good pick for elementary school-age kids.Google rounds those out with an incredible keyboard and a 1080p webcam. This is the Chromebook of your dreams, minus that undeniably rather steep price tag. And while the kids might enjoy watching their favorite cartoons and playing casual games on that sharp display, you&#x2019;ll also love using this for that occasional work email you have to squeeze in between spending time with them.</p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/reviews\/google-pixelbook-go-review\"><u>Google Pixelbook Go</u></a>
